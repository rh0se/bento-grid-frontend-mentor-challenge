# 🧩 Frontend Mentor - Bento Grid Layout Solution

This is my solution to a bento grid challenge, heavily inspired by [Kevin Powell’s tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nJ3SV0Vybk). The project showcases a responsive layout using CSS Grid, `grid-template-areas`, and a combination of Tailwind CSS with custom properties.

- CSS Grid & `grid-template-areas`
- Responsive Design

## ✨ What I Learned

- **Using `@layer` in Tailwind:** I learned how to write custom base, layout, and utility styles within Tailwind’s architecture using the `@layer` directive.
- **Customizing Tailwind with CSS Variables:** I implemented a design system using CSS custom properties (colors, spacing, font sizes) to keep things consistent and scalable.
- **Advanced CSS Grid Layouts:** The use of `grid-template-areas` allowed me to create complex responsive layouts in a clean and readable way.
- **Hybrid Styling Approach:** This project taught me how to balance Tailwind utility classes with custom CSS for more flexible design control.

## 🔧 Continued Development

- I want to explore more ways of combining custom media queries with Tailwind's responsive utilities.
- I plan to use `@layer` more often in future projects for managing layout-specific styles cleanly.
- I'll practice implementing other creative grid layouts and enhance my grasp of visual hierarchy and spacing.
